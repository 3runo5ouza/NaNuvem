NaNuvem
=======

NaNuvem is an on-line file hosting project, built upon CodeIgniter and Bootstrap.

The team is headquartered in Campos do Jordão, São Paulo, Brazil, and it's formed by IFSP students.

Its goal is to bring more freedom in the way we store and retrieve our files online, without losing privacy.
